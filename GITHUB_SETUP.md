# GitHub Setup Instructions

🎉 **Your Databricks ETL Pipeline project is ready for GitHub!**

## 📋 Final Steps to Push to Your GitHub

### 1. Create a new repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon → "New repository"
3. Name it: `Databricks-ETL-Pipeline-Azure`
4. Description: `End-to-end ETL pipeline using Azure Databricks, PySpark, and Delta Lake with Bronze-Silver-Gold architecture`
5. Choose **Public** (to showcase your work) or **Private**
6. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect your local repository to GitHub
```powershell
# Add all files to git
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete Databricks ETL Pipeline with PySpark and Delta Lake"

# Connect to your GitHub repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Customize your repository
After pushing, you can:
- Edit the repository description on GitHub
- Add topics/tags: `databricks`, `pyspark`, `delta-lake`, `azure`, `etl-pipeline`, `data-engineering`
- Enable GitHub Pages for documentation (if desired)
- Set up branch protection rules
